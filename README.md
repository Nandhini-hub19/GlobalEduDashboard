# Global Education Dashboard – UNESCO Project (2023)

This Excel project was created as part of my role as a Junior Data Analyst for a simulated UNESCO task. The goal was to clean raw education data and build a clear dashboard that shows global trends, gaps, and comparisons for the year 2023.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Sheet: Cleaned_Data)

Steps followed to clean the raw dataset:
- Removed total rows
- Cleaned percentage columns by removing `%`
- Converted GDP and population to numeric values (removed "$", "USD", "M", words)
- Standardized region and country names
- Fixed spelling issues like “avg yrs of schooling”
- Replaced “n/a” with blanks or meaningful values
- Trimmed and renamed columns (e.g., "Literacy Rate %" → "Literacy Rate (%)")


## 📊 Data Analysis (with PivotTables & Formulas)

Used Excel formulas and PivotTables to answer key questions:
- Average Literacy Rate per Region
- Country with the highest and lowest Internet Access
- Total Population where Literacy Rate is below 80%
- Region with highest average GDP per Capita

---

## 📈 Charts Created

The following charts were created to show insights visually:
- Bar Chart – Literacy Rate by Country
- Pie Chart – Population by Region
- Line Chart – Literacy Rate vs Internet Access (simulated over 3 years)
- Optional Map – Literacy Rate by Country



## 📊 Excel Dashboard (Sheet: Dashboard)

The dashboard includes:
- KPIs: Average Literacy Rate, Global Internet Access Avg, Total Population
- Slicers for Region and Country
- All charts arranged in a neat, color-coded layout
- Title and insights added

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Literacy rates are not the same in all regions.
- Internet access and education do not always go together.
- Some regions are improving slowly in education, while others are doing well.
